Let me explain how the machine detection algorithm works by showing you the specific patterns and logic used to identify machine-answered calls.

Now let me show you some real examples from your results to demonstrate how this works:

## **How Machine Detection Works**

The algorithm uses a **sophisticated multi-layered approach** to identify machine-answered calls:

### **1. Pattern Matching System (5 Categories)**

**ðŸ”´ Voicemail Indicators (Weight: 3x)**
- "the person you are trying to reach is not available"
- "please record your message"
- "at the tone" / "at the turn" (common transcription error)
- "when you have finished recording"

**ðŸŸ¡ Automated Responses (Weight: 2x)**
- "this call is now being recorded"
- "press 1 for...", "press 2 for..."
- "our office hours are"
- "all representatives are busy"

**ðŸŸ  Assistant Indicators (Weight: 2.5x)**
- "I noticed you've been quiet"
- "are you still there"
- "can you hear me"
- Multiple "hello" repetitions

**ðŸ”´ System Messages (Weight: 4x - Highest)**
- "the number you have dialed"
- "this number has been disconnected"
- "invalid number"
- "please try again later"

**ðŸŸ¢ Silence Indicators (Weight: 2x)**
- "no response"
- "line is quiet"
- "not responding"

### **2. Flow Pattern Detection (Weight: 5x)**
Detects **conversation sequences** that indicate machines:
- "hello + forwarded + voicemail"
- "not available + record + message"
- "quiet + still there"

### **3. Heuristic Analysis**
- **Short responses** (<10 words): +1 point
- **Repetitive content**: +2 points  
- **Multiple numbers** (>3 digits): +2 points

### **4. Scoring & Classification**

**Total Score â‰¥ 3.0 = Machine Answered**
**Total Score < 3.0 = Human Answered**

## **Real Examples from Your Data:**

### **ðŸ¤– Machine Example (Score: 32.0)**
```
"voicemail. the person you are trying to reach is not available. 
at the tone, please record your message. when you have finished recording you may hang up"
```
**Detected Patterns:**
- 5 voicemail indicators (5 Ã— 3 = 15 points)
- 3 flow patterns (3 Ã— 5 = 15 points)
- Repetitive content (+2 points)
**Total: 32 points â†’ MACHINE**

### **ðŸ‘¤ Human Example (Score: 2.0)**
```
"assistant: hello, this is priya from elevatenow. am i speaking with sravanthi?
user: yes?
assistant: great! i noticed you were checking out our nano plan..."
```
**Detected Patterns:**
- Only repetitive content (+2 points)
**Total: 2 points â†’ HUMAN**

### **ðŸ¤– Assistant Timeout (Score: 12.0)**
```
"assistant: hello, this is priya from elevatenow. am i speaking with upasana?
assistant: i noticed you've been quiet. are you still there?"
```
**Detected Patterns:**
- 2 assistant indicators (2 Ã— 2.5 = 5 points)
- 1 flow pattern (1 Ã— 5 = 5 points) 
- Repetitive content (+2 points)
**Total: 12 points â†’ MACHINE**

The algorithm achieves **excellent separation**: average machine score of **15.13** vs human score of **1.98**, showing clear distinction between automated systems and real human conversations.
