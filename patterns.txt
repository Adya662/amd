empty transcripts 
one line only transcript 

I dont understand these calls do hang up, there has to be a diferent way I need to assess the dataset


if voicemail:
-> Your call has been forwarded to voicemail
-> The person you are trying to reach is not available. At the turn? Please record your message. You have finished recording you may hang up.
-> Your call has voicemail. The person you are trying to reach is not available. At the turn, please record your message."
-> When you have finished recording, you may hang up."
-> This call is now being recorded
-> Forward forwarded to voicemail
-> assistant speaking:I noticed you've been quiet. Are you still"


I think we need to dig deep in calls greater than 30seconds

filter out all the transcripts that have only one assistant utterance and are empty.
